Increased_Cost Estimate

1. I doubled the EC2s for more load balancing and give better performance (4 instances for web, 4 instances for app).

2. I added two new Amazon DocumentDB (Master & Replica) along with RDS MySQL, this will act as an authentication database, which reduce the load in the MySQL database which holds the business side of the application.

3. I added Secrets Manager to protect my app secrets.

4. Start using ElasticCache to implement it on our system for higher performance.

5. Added ready 4  t2.micro instances for staging/testing environments.

6. Enabled Amazon Route 53 to support fail overs incase of disaster recovery to route the DNS in no time to backup region.
