1. Identify tools that will allow you to do the following: 
	a. Scan infrastructure as code templates.
		* Cfripper
		* cfn-lint
		* If we are using Terraform as IaC language, then we can use the following tools:
			* Chef inspec
			* Open policy agent / Regula
			* Terrascan

	b. Scan AMI’s or containers for OS vulnerabilities.
		* For container open source tools include:
			* Clair
			* Anchore
			* Trivy

		* For AWS instancse:
			* AWS Inspector

	c. Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities.
		* AWS Config
		* AWS SecuirtyHub

2. For each tool - identify an example compliance violation or vulnerability which it might expose.

	a. Scan infrastructure as code templates:
		These tools can help us find misconfiguration or vulnerability such as defining an IAM Policy that is allowing full access to all services or some of them.

	b. Scan AMI’s or containers for OS vulnerabilities:
		These tools can detect:
			1. Allowing SSH password login
			2. Vulnerabilities to Django libraries

	c. Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities:
		1. An IAM role assigned a policy that allows admin access.
		2. Disk storage has been provisioned without volume encryption enabled.
		3. A server instance has been created and configured to allow RDP connections from the public internet.
