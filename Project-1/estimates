Write a paragraph or two describing the achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for this Multi-AZ, multi-region database in terms of:

As per AWS docs [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html], "The failover times are typically 60â€“120 seconds, However, large transactions or a lengthy recovery process can increase failover time. When the failover is complete, it can take additional time for the RDS console to reflect the new Availability Zone."

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage

	I would say the minimum RTO will be 60 seconds (failover times) + 120 seconds (RDS Reflect the new AZ) = 3 minutes.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
	First We nee need to promote the replica to make it a standalone database instance and then point our application to the new instance.
	And of course we need to consider the time we receieved the email alert for example and the time it took us to contact the support team,
	as well as how the documentation recovery steps are easy to follow.
	 
	RTO = Team awareness + Promote Time (which might be few minutes) + Point the application to the new instace (should also take few minutes)

	I believe it might take minumum 20 minutes

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
	RPO = 3 Minutes

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
	Since we have a point-in-time recovery (which is a continous backup), so it always synced

	So it would be the same as the RTO 20 minutes.
